# React.js - To-Do list

This 'To-Do list' was the first time I ever encountered or used React.js for a job interview pre-assessment - due to this, I didn't want to attempt to 'wow' them with bells & whistles that I didn't understand, so I kept it simple, functional and most importantly - working! 

# What is it exactly?

It's a very simple, 'does what it says on the tin', To-Do list. 

As I was learning a brand new language, I didn't want to fall victim to submitting any code that I didn't understand, for the sake of 'looking good' - I would rather aspire to be *actually* good. 

I was inspired by the tasks I had yet to complete around my house, and liked the idea of creating something functional that worked, so this seemed like a good fit.

# Set up & Tools
`npm` is used for set up and install

I often like to specify my own port for `localhost` to run on. If you wish to do the same, simply modify your package.json as follows;

## Linux & MacOS
* Change the following script from; 
`"start": "react-scripts start"`
* To this;
`"start": "PORT=3006 react-scripts start"`

## Windows 
* Change the following script from; 
`"start": "react-scripts start"`
* To this;
`"start": "set PORT=3006 && react-scripts start"`
